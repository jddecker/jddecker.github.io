Tokyo might seem overwhelming at first, but it's actually a very easy city to explore. From my perspective as someone traveling from the USA, you'll find it convenient, efficient, and full of incredible experiences. These tips come from my own experiences traveling to Tokyo, and while they've worked well for me, everyone's trip might be a little different. Hopefully, they help you navigate the city with confidence and make the most of your visit!

## Etiquette

![Steve Carell yelling with caption "loud noises"](loud%20noises.webp)

There are tons of videos and articles about Japanese etiquette, many of which are accurate but not all essential for travelers. Here are the most important things to keep in mind:

1. **Don't be loud** - Japan is generally a quiet country. If others around you are quiet, match that energy.
2. **Don't talk on your cell phone in public** - Similar to the first rule, speaking on your phone in trains and other public spaces is considered rude. If you need to take a call, step away to a secluded area.
3. **Use the money tray** - When paying at a store or restaurant, place your money or card on the small tray at the counter instead of handing it directly to the cashier. If there's no tray, use both hands when giving or receiving money.

## Japanese to Know

If you don't have time to properly learn Japanese, just focus on these key phrases. They'll take you far.

1. **[Sumimasen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGcxg9i0QI)** - A versatile word meaning *excuse me* or *sorry*. Use it to get someone's attention, lightly apologize, or navigate through a crowd. If you only learn one word, make it this one.
2. **[Arigato Gozaimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPEdMdyMLg)** - A polite way to say *thank you*. Perfect for everyday interactions, especially with store staff or restaurant servers.
3. **[Onegaishimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUgfrtPTBGo)** - A formal way to say *please*, often used when ordering food. Just point to an item on the menu and say, *onegaishimasu.*

## Using Your Phone

### Essential Apps

![Yoda with caption "learn to use your phone you must"](learn%20to%20use%20your%20phone.webp)

Along with **Google Maps** and **Google Translate** (download offline maps and Japanese for backup), these apps can make your trip smoother:

* **[NERV](https://nerv.app/en/)** - A disaster prevention app that provides real-time alerts for earthquakes, tsunamis, and other emergencies. Set it up and enable notifications.
* **[GO Taxi](https://go.goinc.jp/lp/inbound)** - A widely used taxi-hailing app in Japan, similar to Uber or Lyft. Enter your destination, set your pickup location, and a taxi will come to you. Credit cards are accepted in-app.
* **[Suikakeibo](https://suikakeibo.jp/en)** - A Suica card balance checker. Only needed if you're using a **physical** Suica card, as mobile Suica users can check their balance in their phone's wallet app.

### Getting Phone Data  

If your phone is **unlocked** and supports **eSIM**, I highly recommend using one of these providers:  

* **[Ubigi](https://www.ubigi.com/)** - My personal choice.
* **[Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/)** - A popular option that many travelers recommend.

If your phone **doesn't support eSIM**, you have two main options:  

* **Check with your carrier** for international roaming plans.
* **Rent a pocket WiFi device**, such as one from [Japan Wireless](https://www.japan-wireless.com/en).

I've always used an eSIM, so I don't have firsthand experience with the other options, but they are commonly used by travelers.

## Getting Around Tokyo

### Paying for Transport

![Welcome Suica card](welcome%20suica%20card.webp)

To pay for trains and buses, you have a few options:

* **Paper Tickets** - Available at ticket machines, but not recommended due to the hassle.
* **IC Cards** (Suica, Pasmo, etc.) - Convenient rechargeable transit cards.
* **Mobile Suica** (iPhone only for travelers) - The Suica app works on iPhones but is only available on Android phones sold in Japan.

I always use the **Welcome Suica** physical card. It works like a regular Suica card but has some key differences:

| Feature | Regular Suica | Welcome Suica |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target Audience | General public | Tourists |
| Expires | ✔️ 10 years after last use | ❌ 28 days (regardless of use) |
| Deposit | ❌ Required | ✔️ Not required |
| Refunds | ✔️ Allowed | ❌ Not allowed |

A **Welcome Suica** can be purchased with a credit card, but refills must be made in cash. Since refunds aren't possible, spend any remaining balance at convenience stores before you leave Japan.

For a deeper dive, [PiQtour has a great article and video on Suica and IC cards](https://piqtour.com/iccards/).

### How to Navigate the Metro

![Tokyo Metro map](tokyo%20metro.webp)

The easiest way to get around is to use **Google Maps**. Enter your destination and select the public transport option.

I like to adjust a few settings for better results:

* Set *preferred mode* to **train and rail**.
* Change *filter by* to **Less walking** to prioritize routes with minimal walking.
* Set *connecting modes* to **ride services** (turn off *drive* and *bicycle*).

Here's an example of mapping from Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden to the Imperial Palace East Garden:

![Google Maps example screenshot](google%20maps%20example.webp)

I've marked key details for navigating the metro:

* Your starting station is **Shinjuku-gyoemmae Sta. (M10)**. 
* Find the **Marunouchi Line** (look for the red "M" symbol), head to **Platform 2**, and board a **local** train (*express* and *limited express* trains skip certain stops).
* Google Maps often suggests the best train car for a quick exit (optional but helpful).
* Get off at **Otemachi Sta. (M18)**.
* Exit via **C13a**. If you don't see it, follow signs for **Marunouchi District Gate**.

## Quick Tips

Here are some final quick tips:

* Pack light if you can.
* Bring some Japanese Yen in cash. Credit cards are accepted in many places, but you'll likely need physical cash at some point. *I tend to spend around ¥10,000 per person per week in cash.*
* Always carry your passport. It's your official ID in Japan, and authorities can request to see it.
* Be prepared for lots of walking and stairs (wear comfortable shoes or whatever works for you).
* Bathrooms in Japan are great, but the ones in shopping centers, restaurants, and hotels tend to be the best.
* Bring hand sanitizer in case a public bathroom doesn't have soap.
* Pack your suitcase inside another suitcase so you can bring back two if you shop a lot.
* Stay within a 5-10 minute walk of a Tokyo Metro or JR line for easy access to transit.
* When given the option to pay in Japanese Yen or US Dollars, choose Yen. With 1 USD ≈ 150 JPY as of this writing, you'll usually get a better deal.
* Bring deodorant. Good options are harder to find in Japan.
* Fill out your customs form in advance through [Japan Web](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/) and use the QR code at customs instead of handwriting a form.
