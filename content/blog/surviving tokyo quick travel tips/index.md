Plum blossoms in Japan are just as beautiful as cherry blossoms

Tokyo can feel overwhelming, but it's easier than you think. Coming from the USA, I found it surprisingly convenient, efficient, and full of incredible experiences. These tips are based on my own adventures in Tokyo.

## The Golden Rule: Match the Volume

![Steve Carell yelling with caption "loud noises"](loud%20noises.webp)

There are endless articles about Japanese etiquette, but if you only remember one thing, make it this: match the volume of the people around you.

Japan is remarkably quiet. Whether you're on a train or walking through neighborhoods, it feels like most people talk at a whisper compared to the US.

Sometimes later at night at restaurants or at izakayas (think Japanese pubs), people will open up and be much louder.

Matching the volume is a great way to be polite.

## Japanese to Know

If you don't have time to properly learn Japanese, just focus on these key phrases. They'll take you far.

1. **[Sumimasen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGcxg9i0QI)** - You'll use this the most. It's a great way to get someone's attention in a shop or store as well as if you need to squeeze by someone on a crowded train. Think of it like "excuse me" in English.
2. **[Arigato Gozaimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPEdMdyMLg)** - A polite "thank you." Use this with staff at shops and restaurants.
3. **[Onegaishimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUgfrtPTBGo)** - "Please." If you're ordering food, just point at the menu and say this.

## Your Phone: Your Best Friend in Tokyo

![Yoda with caption "learn to use your phone you must"](learn%20to%20use%20your%20phone.webp)

A working data connection is a big quality-of-life upgrade. Relying on your phone for navigation and translation can make a trip much easier.

### Essential Apps

Besides **Google Maps** and **Google Translate** (download offline maps and Japanese language!), these apps can really simplify things:

* **[NERV](https://nerv.app/en/)** - A disaster prevention app that provides real-time alerts for earthquakes, tsunamis, and other emergencies. Set it up and turn on notifications.
* **[GO Taxi](https://go.goinc.jp/lp/inbound)** - Like Uber or Lyft, this app makes hailing a taxi super easy. Enter your destination, set your pickup, and a taxi will come to you. Credit cards are accepted.
* **[Suikakeibo](https://suikakeibo.jp/en)** - This is only if you're using a physical Suica card. If you have a mobile Suica (through your iPhone), you're covered and can check your balance in your phone's wallet.

### Getting Data

If your phone is **unlocked** and supports **eSIM**, I highly recommend using one of these providers:

* **[Ubigi](https://www.ubigi.com/)** - My personal choice.
* **[Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/)** - A popular option that many travelers recommend.

Think of an eSIM like adding a virtual SIM card to your phone.

If your phone has dual-SIM, you can keep your home SIM active for texts while using the eSIM for data. I did this on my Pixel 7 with WiFi calling enabled and it worked perfectly.

If your phone **doesn't support eSIM**, you have two main options:  

* **Check with your carrier** for international roaming plans.
* **Rent a pocket WiFi device**, such as one from [Japan Wireless](https://www.japan-wireless.com/en). *Keep in mind you'll need to keep track of it, charge it, and it limits your group's ability to split up.*

I've always used an eSIM, while I haven't tried the other options personally, I've read that they are popular alternatives.

## Getting Around

Tokyo's transit system is world-class, but navigating train stations can be daunting. Google Maps is your best tool here. It's very accurate with subway timings and platform numbers.

### Paying for Transport

![Welcome Suica card](welcome%20suica%20card.webp)

To pay for trains and buses, you have a few options:

* **Paper Tickets** - Available at ticket machines, but not recommended due to the hassle.
* **IC Cards** (Suica, Pasmo, etc.) - Convenient rechargeable transit cards.
* **Mobile Suica** (iPhone only for travelers) - The Suica app works on iPhones and Android phones purchased in Japan.

I always use the **Welcome Suica** physical card. It's like a regular Suica but with these key differences:

| Feature | Regular Suica | Welcome Suica |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target Audience | General public | Tourists |
| Expires | ✔️ 10 years after last use | ❌ 28 days (regardless of use) |
| Deposit | ❌ Required | ✔️ Not required |
| Refunds | ✔️ Allowed | ❌ Not allowed |

You buy a Welcome Suica with a credit card and add money to it. Just remember it expires after 28 days! You can't get a refund on any money left on it, so spend it at convenience stores before you leave. [PiQtour has a great article and video on Suica and IC cards](https://piqtour.com/iccards/).

### How to Navigate the Metro

![Tokyo Metro map](tokyo%20metro.webp)

The easiest way to get around is to use **Google Maps**. Enter your destination and select the public transport option.

I like to adjust a few settings for better results:

* Set *preferred mode* to **train and rail**.
* Change *filter by* to **Less walking** to prioritize routes with minimal walking.
* Set *connecting modes* to **ride services** (turn off *drive* and *bicycle*).

For example, let's say you're going from Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden to the Imperial Palace East Garden:

![Google Maps example screenshot](google%20maps%20example.webp)

I've marked key details for navigating the metro:

* Your starting station is **Shinjuku-gyoemmae Sta. (M10)**. 
* Find the **Marunouchi Line** (look for the red "M" symbol), head to **Platform 2**, and board a **local** train (*express* and *limited express* trains skip certain stops, while *local* trains go to every stop on their line).
* Google Maps often suggests the best train car for a quick exit.
* Get off at **Otemachi Sta. (M18)**.
* Exit via **C13a**. If you don't see it, follow signs for **Marunouchi District Gate**.

## Quick Tips for a Smooth Trip

Here are some final quick tips:

* Pack light if you can. There are lots of stairs and it's easier to use trians.
* Carry some cash. While cards are becoming more common, you'll still need Yen for small shops and temples. I budget about ¥10,000 per person per week in cash, more if you plan on hitting the Gachapon (capsule toy) machines.
* Always carry your passport. It's your legal ID in Japan, and you're required to show it if requested by authorities.
* Be prepared for lots of walking and stairs (wear comfortable shoes or whatever works for you).
* Bathrooms in Japan are great, but the ones in shopping centers, restaurants, and hotels tend to be the best.
* Bring hand sanitizer in case a public bathroom doesn't have soap.
* Pack your suitcase inside another suitcase so you can bring back two if you shop a lot.
* Aim to stay within a 5-10 minute walk of a Tokyo Metro or JR line.
* When given the option to pay in Japanese Yen or US Dollars, choose Yen. With 1 USD ≈ 150 JPY as of this writing, you'll usually get a better deal.
* Pack your own deodorant. It can be hard to find in Japan, and local versions are often much weaker than Western brands.
* Fill out your customs form in advance through [Visit Japan Web](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/). Using the QR code at the airport is much faster than handwriting paper forms.
