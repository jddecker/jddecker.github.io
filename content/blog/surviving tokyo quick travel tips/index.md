Plum blossoms in Japan are just as beautiful as cherry blossoms

Tokyo can feel overwhelming at first, but trust me, it's easier than you think! Coming from the USA, I found it surprisingly convenient and efficient, full of incredible experiences. These tips are based on my own adventures in Tokyo, and while everyone's journey is different, I hope they give you the confidence to explore with ease and make the most of your trip.

## A Little Etiquette Goes a Long Way

You'll find tons of articles about Japanese etiquette, and a lot of it's good advice. But here are the key things to keep in mind for a smooth experience:

1. **Keep the noise down** - Japan is a pretty quiet country. Try to match the sound level around you. This is really the biggest thing.
2. **Follow the rules** - They're there for a reason! Even if something seems odd, go with the flow. No eating on trains, and be sure to stand behind the yellow line at train stations.
3. **Blend in (a little)** - Just observing what others do can make a big difference. Walk on the left side of sidewalks (except in Osaka!) and face forward on trains.

## Japanese to Know

!["Japanese people learning English" with kid giving a thumbs up. "English speakers learning Japanese" with Plankton from Spongebob straining.](learning%20japanese.webp)

If you don't have time to properly learn Japanese, just focus on these key phrases. They'll take you far.

1. **[Sumimasen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGcxg9i0QI)** - This is your Swiss Army Knife! It means "excuse me" or "sorry". Use it to get someone's attention, apologize lightly, or navigate a crowded space. Seriously, learn this one.
2. **[Arigato Gozaimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPEdMdyMLg)** - A polite "thank you." Perfect for interacting with shop staff or restaurant servers.
3. **[Onegaishimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUgfrtPTBGo)** - A more formal "please". Especially useful when ordering food. Just point to an item on the menu and say, "onegaishimasu".

## Your Phone: Your Best Friend in Tokyo

### Essential Apps

![Yoda with caption "learn to use your phone you must"](learn%20to%20use%20your%20phone.webp)

Besides **Google Maps** and **Google Translate** (download offline maps and Japanese language!), these apps can really simplify things:

* **[NERV](https://nerv.app/en/)** - A disaster prevention app that provides real-time alerts for earthquakes, tsunamis, and other emergencies. Set it up and turn on notifications.
* **[GO Taxi](https://go.goinc.jp/lp/inbound)** - Like Uber or Lyft, this app makes hailing a taxi super easy. Enter your destination, set your pickup, and a taxi will come to you. Credit cards are accepted.
* **[Suikakeibo](https://suikakeibo.jp/en)** - This is only if you're using a physical Suica card. If you have a mobile Suica (through your iPhone), you're covered and can check your balance in your phone's wallet.

### Getting Data

If your phone is **unlocked** and supports **eSIM**, I highly recommend using one of these providers:

* **[Ubigi](https://www.ubigi.com/)** - My personal choice.
* **[Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/)** - A popular option that many travelers recommend.

If you have a dual-SIM phone, you can use your regular SIM for calls and texts while using your eSIM for data. It's a great combo! I'm doing this on my Pixel 7 with WiFi calling enabled, and it works great. It should work on iOS too.

If your phone **doesn't support eSIM**, you have two main options:  

* **Check with your carrier** for international roaming plans.
* **Rent a pocket WiFi device**, such as one from [Japan Wireless](https://www.japan-wireless.com/en).

I've always used an eSIM, so I don't have firsthand experience with the other options, but they are commonly used by travelers.

## Getting Around

### Paying for Transport

![Welcome Suica card](welcome%20suica%20card.webp)

To pay for trains and buses, you have a few options:

* **Paper Tickets** - Available at ticket machines, but not recommended due to the hassle.
* **IC Cards** (Suica, Pasmo, etc.) - Convenient rechargeable transit cards.
* **Mobile Suica** (iPhone only for travelers) - The Suica app works on iPhones and Android phones purchased in Japan.

I always use the **Welcome Suica** physical card. It's like a regular Suica but with these key differences:

| Feature | Regular Suica | Welcome Suica |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target Audience | General public | Tourists |
| Expires | ✔️ 10 years after last use | ❌ 28 days (regardless of use) |
| Deposit | ❌ Required | ✔️ Not required |
| Refunds | ✔️ Allowed | ❌ Not allowed |

You buy a Welcome Suica with a credit card and add money to it. Just remember it expires after 28 days! You can't get a refund on any money left on it, so spend it at convenience stores before you leave. [PiQtour has a great article and video on Suica and IC cards](https://piqtour.com/iccards/).

### How to Navigate the Metro

![Tokyo Metro map](tokyo%20metro.webp)

The easiest way to get around is to use **Google Maps**. Enter your destination and select the public transport option.

I like to adjust a few settings for better results:

* Set *preferred mode* to **train and rail**.
* Change *filter by* to **Less walking** to prioritize routes with minimal walking.
* Set *connecting modes* to **ride services** (turn off *drive* and *bicycle*).

For example, let's say you're going from Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden to the Imperial Palace East Garden:

![Google Maps example screenshot](google%20maps%20example.webp)

I've marked key details for navigating the metro:

* Your starting station is **Shinjuku-gyoemmae Sta. (M10)**. 
* Find the **Marunouchi Line** (look for the red "M" symbol), head to **Platform 2**, and board a **local** train (*express* and *limited express* trains skip certain stops).
* Google Maps often suggests the best train car for a quick exit (optional but helpful).
* Get off at **Otemachi Sta. (M18)**.
* Exit via **C13a**. If you don't see it, follow signs for **Marunouchi District Gate**.

## Quick Tips for a Smooth Trip

Here are some final quick tips:

* Pack light if you can.
* Bring some Japanese Yen in cash. Credit cards are accepted in many places, but you'll likely need physical cash at some point. *I tend to spend around ¥10,000 per person per week in cash.*
* Always carry your passport. It's your official ID in Japan, and authorities can request to see it.
* Be prepared for lots of walking and stairs (wear comfortable shoes or whatever works for you).
* Bathrooms in Japan are great, but the ones in shopping centers, restaurants, and hotels tend to be the best.
* Bring hand sanitizer in case a public bathroom doesn't have soap.
* Pack your suitcase inside another suitcase so you can bring back two if you shop a lot.
* Stay within a 5-10 minute walk of a Tokyo Metro or JR line for easy access to transit.
* When given the option to pay in Japanese Yen or US Dollars, choose Yen. With 1 USD ≈ 150 JPY as of this writing, you'll usually get a better deal.
* Bring deodorant. Good options are harder to find in Japan.
* Fill out your customs form in advance through [Japan Web](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/) and use the QR code at customs instead of handwriting a form.
