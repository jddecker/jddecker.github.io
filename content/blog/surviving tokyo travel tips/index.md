As intimidating as Japan seems like, it is pretty easy to get around

## Etiquette

There are lots of videos and articles about hundreds of etiquette rules in Japan. Although a lot of the information is correct, most of the things you don't need to worry about as a traveler. I feel like these are the most important things:

1. **Don't be loud** - Japan is a quiet country. It's easiest to only be loud if you notice others are being loud.
2. **Don't hand money directly to someone** - Most of the time when purchasing something, there will be a little tray. Put your money or credit card on that if you have to hand it to someone. If there isn't a tray, use both hands in giving or receiving money from someone's hands.
3. **Be polite** - Even if you don't know Japanese, being polite can get you far. Most people will understand you if you say *please* and *thank you* in English.
4. **Don't rest your chopsticks straight up in your food** - When you put down your chopsticks, put them across your bowl instead of sticking them straight up in your food.

## Japanese to Know

If you don’t have time to dive into learning Japanese, just focus on these key phrases. These will take you far.

1. **[Sumimasen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGcxg9i0QI)** - A versatile word meaning excuse me or sorry. Use it to get someone's attention, apologize lightly, or navigate through a crowd. If you only learn one word, make it this one.
2. **[Arigato Gozaimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPEdMdyMLg)** - A polite way to say thank you. Great for everyday interactions, especially with store staff or restaurant servers.
3. **[Onegaishimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUgfrtPTBGo)** - A formal way to say *please*. Commonly used when ordering food. Just point to an item on the menu and say, *onegaishimasu*.

## Essential Phone Apps

In addition to **Google Maps** and **Google Translate** (be sure to download offline maps and Japanese for offline use), these Japan-specific apps can make your trip even smoother:

* **[NERV](https://nerv.app/en/)** - A disaster prevention app that provides real-time alerts for earthquakes, tsunamis, and other emergencies. Set it up and enable notifications.
* **[GO Taxi](https://go.goinc.jp/lp/inbound)** - A widely used taxi-hailing app in Japan. Works like Uber or Lyft. Enter your destination, set your pickup location, and a taxi will come to you. Credit card payments are accepted in-app.
* **[Suikakeibo](https://suikakeibo.jp/en)** - A Suica card balance checker. Useful only if you're using a physical Suica card.

## Getting Around Tokyo

### Paying for Transport

When it comes to paying for trains and buses, you have a few options:

* **Paper Tickets** - Available at ticket machines, but not recommended due to the hassle.
* **IC Cards** (Suica, Pasmo, etc.) – Convenient rechargeable transit cards.
* **Mobile Suica** (iPhone only for travelers) – The Suica app works on iPhones but is only available for Android phones sold in Japan.

I've always used the Welcome Suica physical card. It functions like a regular Suica card, but has some differences:

|                 | Regular Suica           | Welcome Suica                |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Target Audience | General public          | Tourists                     |
| Expires         | 10 years after last use | 28 days (regardless of use)  |
| Deposit         | Required                | Not required                 |
| Refunds         | Allowed                 | Not allowed                  |

A Welcome Suica can be purchased with a credit card, but refills must be made in cash. Since you can’t get a refund on the balance, consider spending any leftover funds at convenience stores before leaving Japan.
